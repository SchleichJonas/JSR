# JSR - The Java Test Suite Reduction Framework 

JSR is a test suite reduction framework for Java. It consists of the following modules:


* JSR Core
* JSR CLI
* JSR IntelliJ IDE plugin


## Important Notice:

Please note that JSR is currently still undergoing active Development. Features are subject to change and the installation process will change in the future. 
Our long-term goal is to create a test suite reduction framework for practical use in the software industry. If you want to contribute to JSR, please feel free to submit an issue or a PR. I would be happy if you want to get in touch with me.


## JSR Core

The core framework module, containing the functionality and implementation of algorithms, interactions with programs, libraries, etc.

More specifically, the Core modules provides APIs to clients for the following features:

* Test suite parsing and TS information collection
* Coverage calculation
* TSR calculation
* Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SFL) Matrix export

## JSR CLI

A CLI frontend of the JSR framework, supporting the following features:

* Test Suite Reduction
  * Using different coverage metrics
  * Using different TSR algorithms
    * Greedy HGS
    * Genetic 
* FSL Matrix export

## IntelliJ IDE Plugin

The IntelliJ IDE Plugin serves as the front-end GUI. It directly integrates with 
IntelliJ so that developers can interact with JSR in a convenient and 
already established way. The Plugin provides JSR-Core functionality with a few 
additional features that only make sense in the IDE/GUI context:

* Define and persist JSR settings (paths, package names)
* Adjust TSR parameters (coverage type, TSR algorithm, Code generation)
* Perform a fresh TSR round (including coverage report generation)
* Perform  TSR round based on an already existent coverage report
* List retained and redundant test cases after a TSR round
* On click of a TC from the lists, the TC is opened up in the editor

## Installation

This chapter outlines how to install JSR. All steps are required to set it up properly.

Please note that the installation process is subject to change as the project progresses.

### 1. Requirements

* Java JDK 11 
  * make sure it is set as the default JDK version on your system
  * make sure, `JAVA_HOME` points to your default JDK
* Maven 3.8.7 (required for building Slicer4J)
* Gradle 7.6 (required for building this project)

### 2. JSR Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project root directory

```shell
git git@github.com:SchleichJonas/JSR.git 
cd JSR
```

2. Execute the installation script to clone and build Slicer4J. 

```shell
sh install.sh
```

3. Build the JSR project (this will build the Core, CLI and IntelliJ Plugin modules)
   
Before building the actual project though, we need to initialize our testing environment so that the 
project build can properly run the unit tests:
   
```shell
cd jsr/JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject
gradle
gradle build -x test
gradle testJar
```

Then, we can finally build the JSR framework

```shell
cd ../../.././../.. #so that we're in the 'jsr' root directory 
gradle
gradle build
```

Congratulations, JSR was built successfully.

Note: The commands in step 3 can also be started by opening the 
respective projects in IntelliJ and running the gradle tasks from the gradle plugin.

## Starting the IntelliJ Plugin

The JSR IntelliJ plugin is not yet published. Thus, it cannot simply be installed into your IntelliJ IDE instance.

Currently, one has to start IntelliJ in sandbox mode to work with the JSR plugin. The easiest way is to run:

```shell
gradle JSR-IntelliJ-Plugin:runIde
```

Alternatively, when the JSR project is already opened in IntelliJ, 
one can run the same gradle task from the gradle plugin.

## Using the IntelliJ Plugin

The following rundown is based on the `smallProject` that is used for integration tests
in the core library.

To try out the plugin, run IntelliJ as described above and open the `smallProject` 
under `jsr/JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject`.  

This project includes a test suite with around 15 tests of which many are purposefully 
redundant. 

Once the project is loaded and IntelliJ finished building its indexes, open the JSR plugin. 
It should be located either at the left or right hand side bars ("JSR").

#### Settings

JSR needs to know where some parts the project it should be ran on are located. The following 
list explains the settings items (with example values for `smallProject`):

* `Test Directory` is the root directory of your test suite. 
  For default Java projects this is usually similar to `project/src/test/java` 
  
  Example: `smallProject/src/test/java`


* `Source Directory` is the root source code directory of your project.
  For default Java projects this is usually similar to `project/src/main/java` 

  Example: `smallProject/src/main/java`


* `Jar File` is the path to your **fat jar**. This jar must contain the compiled **source and test classes**.  

  Example: `smallProject/build/libs/testJar.jar`


* `Classes Directory` is the path to your compiled java class files (required by JaCoCo)

  Example: `smallProject/build/classes/java/main`


* `Base Source Package` is the base package name of your project classes for which 
  line and method coverage should be calculated. You could use this as a filter if
  you want to perform TSR based on only a part of your project's sources (i.e. a sub package). 
  
  _This is an optional setting._

  Example: `at.tugraz`


* `Slicer Directory` is the path to Slicer4J. This helps JSR to find the 
  correct path to the slicer which is necessary to calculate checked coverage.

  Example: `<jsrProjectRoot>/jsr/slicer/Slicer4J`


* `Output Directory` is the path where all output files generated by JSR should be 
  written to. This directory will contain reports (coverage, Tsr), Exports (SFL) and 
  temporary files.
  
  Example: `smallProject/build/jsr/pluginTest01`


* `Code Output Directory` is the path to the directory where the generated test 
  source code is written to. The generated sources are equal to the orginal test 
  suite sources with the exception of identified redundant test cases. Those
  are deactivated via a JUnit annotation.
  
  Example: `smallProject/build/jsr/pluginTest01/gen`

### Parameters

Under the `TSR Options` tab, you can specify your TSR parameters. 
They should be pretty self expanatory. A short description can be found in the following list:

* `Coverage Report Selection` determines which coverage report should be used for reduction:
  * `New Report` will create a new coverage report with the selected coverage metric
  * `Previous Report` will use a report that was generated in previous TSR runs.
* `Reduction Algorithm` determines the employed algorithm in the reduction step
  * Currently, you can choose between `Greedy HGS` and a `Genetic` algorithm.
* `Deactivate redundant test cases` determines if test suite source code with redundant test cases
  deactivated should be generated or not.
  
### Starting a TSR run

After specifying the required settings and options parameters, you can start a TSR run by 
clicking the `Start TSR` button. Depending on whether a coverage report should be created, 
this might take a while. 

Once the TSR procedure is finished, two lists appear, one containing all relevant and thus _retained_ test cases
and the other one, containing all identified _redundant_ test cases. Clicking on a test case in either list
will trigger a navigation to the test case source code in the IntelliJ editor window(s).

## Using the CLI

The JSR command line interface can be used to leverage TSR core functionality via a command line tool. 
It supports the same settings, parameters and core functionality as the IntelliJ IDE plugin.

Additionally, the CLI supports _Spectrum-based Fault Localization_ matrix export as a bonus feature for research purposes. 

Usage instructions can be found by running 

```shell
java -jar JSR-CLI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jsr --help
```

This produces the following output:

```shell
Usage: jsr [-hV] [COMMAND]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
  
Commands:
  reduce  Reduces a test suite based on the given options and parameters.
  sfl     Creates Spectrum-based Fault Localization matrices.
```

### Performing TSR via the CLI

By invoking the `reduce` subcommand, the CLI can perform TSR: 

```shell
java -jar JSR-CLI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jsr reduce --help
```

This produces the following output:

```shell
Usage: jsr reduce [-hV] [--algorithm=<algorithm>] -c=<pathClasses> [--coverage=<coverageMetric>]
                  [--gen=<pathGenOut>] -j=<pathJar> -l=<pathSlicer> -o=<pathOut>
                  [--package=<basePackage>] [--report=<pathCoverageReport>] -s=<pathSources>
                  <testSourceDir>
Reduces a test suite based on the given options and parameters.

      <testSourceDir>      The root directory of the test suite sources

  -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version            Print version information and exit.

Required Parameters:
  -c, --classes=<pathClasses>
                           The path to the root directory containing the compiled source code
                             classes
  -j, --jar=<pathJar>      The path to the jar file containing the source and test classes
  -l, --slicer=<pathSlicer>
                           The path to the Slicer4J directory
  -o, --out=<pathOut>      The path to the directory where all reports and output files are saved
  -s, --sources=<pathSources>
                           The root directory of the main source code

Optional Parameters:
      --algorithm=<algorithm>
                           The reduction algorithm used to reduce the test suite.
                             Available options: greedyHGS, genetic
                             Default: greedyHGS
      --coverage=<coverageMetric>
                           The coverage metric calculated before the reduction when no coverage
                             report is specified. This option only has an effect if --report is not
                             specified
                             Available options: checked, line, method
                             Default: checked
      --gen=<pathGenOut>   The path to the directory where the modified test classes are generated
                             and saved
      --package=<basePackage>
                           When specified, only classes under this package are instrumented for
                             line and method coverage calculation
      --report=<pathCoverageReport>
                           Path to the coverage report which is used for the reduction
```

A sample call to the CLI for reducing the `smallProject` test suite is provided below. The working 
directory of the command line in this example is `<jsrProjectRoot>/jsr`.

This example performs TSR with optional parameters: It creates a new line coverage report (`--coverage`)
and employs the genetic reduction algorithm (`--algorithm`) that ships with JSR-Core. 
Additionally, test suite source code is generated (`--gen`). 
The `--package` option is set to the base package of the source code classes
to slightly enhance JaCoCo instrumentation and test case execution performance

```shell
java -jar JSR-CLI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jsr reduce
-s JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/src/main/java
-j JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/build/libs/testJar.jar
-l ../slicer/Slicer4J
-o JSR-CLI/build/jsr/cliTest01
-c JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/build/classes/java/main
--gen JSR-CLI/build/jsr/cliTest01/gen
--package at.tugraz.ist.stracke.jsr
--coverage line
--algorithm genetic
JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/src/test/java
```
### Generating SFL Matrices via the CLI

The CLI can generate Spectrum-based Fault Localization matrices by invoking the `sfl` subcommand:

```shell
java -jar JSR-CLI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jsr sfl --help
```

This produces the following output:

```shell
Usage: jsr sfl [-hV] -c=<pathClasses> -j=<pathJar> -l=<pathSlicer> -o=<pathOut>
               [--package=<basePackage>] -s=<pathSources> <testSourceDir>
Creates Spectrum-based Fault Localization matrices.

      <testSourceDir>   The root directory of the test suite sources

  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version         Print version information and exit.

Required Parameters:
  -c, --classes=<pathClasses>
                        The path to the root directory containing the compiled source code classes
  -j, --jar=<pathJar>   The path to the jar file containing the source and test classes
  -l, --slicer=<pathSlicer>
                        The path to the Slicer4J directory
  -o, --out=<pathOut>   The path to the directory where the SFL matrices are written to
  -s, --sources=<pathSources>
                        The root directory of the main source code

Optional Parameters:
      --package=<basePackage>
                        When specified, only classes under this package are instrumented for line
                          and method coverage calculation
```

A sample SFL call is provided below. The `sfl` commands generates 4 reports: 
* `Checked coverage report` using slicing for everything.
* `JaCoCo coverage report` using no slicing at all.
* `Line coverage report` using JaCoCo to create a standard report without slicing.
* `Mixed coverage report` which uses a combination of checked and line coverage. Only failing test are being sliced.

The current `sfl` command tests one variable in each junit test.

```shell
java -jar JSR-CLI-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jsr sfl
-s JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/src/main/java
-j JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/build/libs/testJar.jar
-l ../slicer/Slicer4J
-o JSR-CLI/build/jsr/cliTest01
-c JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/build/classes/java/main
--package at.tugraz
JSR-Core/src/test/resources/smallProject/src/test/java
```

### Python scripts
There are 2 python scrpts included, `SFL.py` and `testall.py`.
To run the script the following dependencies are necessary:
* Python3
* jpype (required for `testall.py`)
* numpy (required for `SFL.py`)

`SFL.py` has some predefined test suites that it is looking for in the sfl matrix and computes HitRatio@1, HitRatio@5 
and WastedEffort for Ochiai, Tarantula and Sarhan-Beszédes. It is automatically looking for lines with `//Error` to
identify the lines with errors in the source code. It creates .txt files for each defined test suite that include
all metrics formated in a latex table.

`testall.py` tests all java classes in the classes folder for their original and altered outputs. The variables it
tests for can be changed by editing the .var files for each class. It then generates rows in latex table format with
their inputs and outputs.

Those 2 scripts can be run with the following commands
```shell
python3 SFL.py
```
```shell
cd classes/
python3 testall.py
```
